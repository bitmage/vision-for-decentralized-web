Instead of monopolies such as the Google and Apple app stores, what if we had a diversity of different marketplaces?  These marketplaces might curate different kinds of applications for different users.  They might editorialize and post news and other content that is relevant for the people they serve.

Using a general technology like a [[Public Ledger]] an organization can build an [[App Registry]].  The organization publishes a corresponding marketplace app, which the user downloads and proceeds to browse the available content.  A marketplace can use various independent [[App Auditing]] parties, which may specialize in security auditing, quality control, or childhood or educational content.
