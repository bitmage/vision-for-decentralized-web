In theory, we could have proof of ownership that doesn't rely upon any central authority, but is validated by the participants of a transaction and witnessed by peers.  In theory we could have an independent [[Adjudicator]] who is capable of reviewing the facts, and is perhaps selected based on knowledge of the specific transaction type, the asset type, the participants, or the nature of their agreement.  Using this technology it should be possible to establish rule of law at lower cost and a higher trust that justice will be served.  Not by relying upon one centralized, standardized body, but by people choosing arbiters that they trust and select based on their background and reputation.
