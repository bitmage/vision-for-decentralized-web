Generally, a Public Ledger may be used for any information which is intended to be public, and which benefits from a consistent verification methodology.  This includes [[Community Currency]], [[Proof of Ownership]], [[Public Agreement]], and [[Public Accountability Ledger]].

For some use cases it may not be appropriate to have member nodes spread around the globe.  It may be appropriate to have a regional network, a municipality network, or a network limited to membership of an organization, a conversation, or other group of people.

[[Holochain]] is based on the concept of allowing networks to be scaled to the appropriate membership, and represents a departure from previous "blockchain" technologies which tend to offer "one network for everybody".

A key question to ask is "Whose consent do I need in order for this information to be considered valid?"  For a financial transaction that may include:

* A buyer
* A seller
* Various witnesses
* An exchange or clearinghouse

The agreeing parties probably don't need to be "the entire world", and [Bitcoin's scalability limitations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_scalability_problem) should be a clear signal that there are costs and limitations to this approach.  A technology that originally was thought to enable faster and lower overhead transactions than current bank transfers has ended up having fees upwards of $10 USD, comparable to a wire transfer.  For reasons of efficiency, speed of processing, and sustainable use of resources we should seek to limit unnecessary data transfer.
