Makes use of [[App Registry]], [[App Marketplace]].

App publishing should be a democratic, open-access process.  Anyone should be able to publish, given that they follow a process of signing their release.  And a user, if they trust the publisher, should be able to install their app without jumping through any more hoops.

That said, most users are going to trust the [[App Auditing]] ecosystem to vet their software for them, so an app publisher who doesn't get on any of the auditors radars is not going to be very successful in the overall marketplace.

The goal with this system is to create a balance of freedom and responsibility.  Reputation is key, and a person's publication history and the overall quality it is found to have will be a predictor of their future success.
