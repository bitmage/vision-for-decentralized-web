##### Overview

Mesh technologies are in development by various parties.  Could these technologies be used to create a network more resilient to physical failures and disasters?  Could this provide more democratic access to the internet, resilient to cancel culture and government and corporate censorship?

One thing is true: physical mesh networks will only get us part way there.  If we still rely upon central servers such as Facebook, Twitter etc. then our communications will still be offline in the case where we cannot communicate with the central hub.  In order to have true decentralization our Information Architecture must also be without centralized linch pins.  Some of the crucial software components are [[Peer Discovery]], [[Blind Relay Nodes]], [[Device Constellation]], [[Private Communication]], and [[Public Ledger]].  All of these components in order to be implemented rely upon [[Public & Secret Key]] and [[Self-Sovereign Identity]].
