Makes use of [[App Registry]], [[Quality Control Processes]], [[Public Claims]].

Having an ecosystem of app auditors would allow auditors to specialize in various functions:

* security auditing
* quality control / works for purpose intended
* appropriate children's content
* appropriate educational content
* religious, moral, or philosophical frameworks
* economic, psychological, scientific validation

These audits could overlay upon apps, and a custom [[App Marketplace]] would allow a user to specify the auditing criteria that are most important to them.  A user could select organizations that they trust, and demote or exclude organizations they do not trust.
