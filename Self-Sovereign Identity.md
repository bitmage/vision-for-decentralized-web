This is the foundation for a free digital landscape, honoring individual autonomy.  Self-Sovereign means that any individual, and indeed any computing device, can generate their own identity without the need for any brokers or gatekeepers.  If there were one or more standard formats for SSID it would mean:

1. You would no longer have to create a unique ID for every website or service that you sign up for.
2. You could still choose to create multiple IDs for purpose of anonymity.
3. We could begin to have private data owned by individuals rather than trusting intermediate brokers [who regularly violate that trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal).
4. Secure communications such as offered by Signal or WhatsApp would become the norm, supported by all apps and not a select few.

SSID can be implemented with [[Public & Secret Key]] algorithms.  In addition, it would be helpful to have a device enrollment process (e.g. by scanning a QR code) which would allow the user to create a [[Device Constellation]].
