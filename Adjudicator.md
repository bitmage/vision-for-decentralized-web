Makes use of [[Public Claims]], [[Private Claims]].

What if we had a network of adjudicators that could be evaluated based on their past history, their published rulings, and the fairness ratings ascribed to them by participants?

What if we could choose to be judged by our peers?  In the case of an entity such as a [[Land Trust]], who would be better qualified to understand the unique agreements involved than the board members of other similarly structured trusts?  Credit unions, governance structures, businesses, and non profits could be similarly governed by groups of peers.  And this could be a consent based authority.  The advantage of groups choosing a model like this is that:

1. They are more likely to experience fair treatment
2. A case could be less costly and less time intensive
3. A person or organization could represent themselves competently, having entered into an agreement in plain language
4. Ability to construct a case that baffles the understanding of adjudicators would be more difficult, given their specialized knowledge

This is more likely to work well if the peers can be selected based on their having already taken on similar responsibilities, and demonstrating their own integrity and follow through.  Such a person will take their role seriously, and has consequences with the constituency of their own organization should they fail to deliver a fair and honest ruling.
